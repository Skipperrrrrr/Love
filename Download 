  <h1>Hi Pudding 😘</h1>
  <h2>Happy 3 Years of Us ❤️</h2>

<section id="our-story">
  <h2>Our Story 💫</h2>
  <p>We met in the university. We were both 17. I was in second year and you were a fresher.
  We met because we were supposed to start a Bacenta on campus together.
  I mean… we started the Bacenta 😅 — but as we kept the fellowship going, our hearts grew fonder 🥹❤️.</p>
  <p>Before we knew it, I enjoyed spending more time with you than even my books 😭.
  Unreasonable but magical 💕.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t love at first sight, but I love how long it took for you to start telling me
  “I haven’t heard from you the whole day.”
  Every day for four years, I thought about you, I came to your room, I ate your food,
  I tried to make you laugh 😅 — and I laughed at you even more —
  only to realize that I had melted to the ground;
  fallen so much in love no one could pick me up.</p>
  <p>On the 5th of July, 2022, I popped the question (not the biggest one but the phrase still works 😂😂).
  Fast forward… it’s been three years and I still really like you.
  I imagine what “happily ever after” with you looks like — teaching our 18-year-old how to drive,
  or celebrating “Kwaku and Lorrie’s 50th anniversary.”
  And I know there’s only one person I see all of that with: <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
  <p>One fun memory? Oh I’ll never forget —
  Hillview Hotel.
  We knew outside food wasn’t allowed, but you and I strolled in with our Waakye 😂
  and found a way to eat it in plain sight.
  I was panicking the whole time that we’d get caught,
  yet somehow I was the one encouraging you to feel free and eat 😂😂😂.
  The only smart move? Buying Coke and lime from them —
  just to give off “we’re customers ooo” energy 😂</p>
  <p>And finally… I’ll forever laugh at your English —
  even though, technically, you understand and know way more words than I do 😭😂😂</p>

  <h2>🛤️ Where We’re Going… Together</h2>
  <p>I picture a life with you that spans across oceans and islands.
  Tropical skies above us, your laughter in my ears, and a camera roll full of sunsets and silly poses.
  From <strong>Zanzibar to Jamaica</strong>, <strong>Santorini to Switzerland</strong>, I want to see the world with you — because you are my world.</p>
  <p>I see a marriage full of joy — not because life will always be easy, but because <strong>I chose you</strong>.
  And if you were a twin, I’d still pick you.</p>
  <p>I see a home where <strong>you are our spiritual covering</strong>, where our children grow up learning to love God because they see it in you first.
  A home where I am cheered on, loved hard, and prayed for by my <strong>biggest support</strong> — you.</p>
  <p>And yes, I see our <strong>twins</strong> — <strong>Nyameye and Adom</strong> — running through the halls, laughing, learning, and being raised by two people madly in love.</p>
  <p><strong>Forever is real to me. Because it looks like you.</strong></p>
